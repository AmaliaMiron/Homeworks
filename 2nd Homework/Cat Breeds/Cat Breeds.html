        The Devon Rex is a relatively newer breed of cats, discovered by accident in the region of Devonshire, England, in 1960 and has been called many things: a pixie cat, an alien cat, a cat that looks like an elf — or a bat. It is also known to behave more like a dog than like a cat.<br /><br/>

        With its unique appearance, the breed has captured the attention of cat lovers worldwide—and the hearts of its families with its lovable, quirky and mischievous personality. </p>
